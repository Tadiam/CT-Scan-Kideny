Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, particularly in detecting and analyzing abnormalities in CT scans. CT scans provide detailed body images and are widely used for diagnosing various conditions, including cancers, injuries, and diseases. However, interpreting CT scans can be challenging and time-consuming for radiologists, leading to the need for advanced technologies like AI to detect abnormalities in the early stages, resulting in better diagnosis and providing early treatments.
Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI in detecting various abnormalities in CT scans, including lung nodules, kidney stones, and heart disease. These studies have reported impressive results, showcasing the potential of AI to assist radiologists in making more accurate and timely diagnosis. Integrating AI into CT scan analysis can transform the field of radiology by improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing interpretation times, and ultimately improving patient care.
Kidney diseases are a significant and growing problem globally and are among the leading causes of death and a contributor to worldwide morbidity. Several factors contribute to the increasing prevalence of heart disease, including an aging population, lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, stress and mental health, and more.

Using datasets of kidney CT Scans, that contain images of kidneys that are normal, have cyst, tumor and stones, to resolve a classification problem. After conducting some preprocessing steps we used two deep learning algorithms, VGG and AlexNet to model.
