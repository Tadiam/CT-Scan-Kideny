Development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in the creation of powerful tools that improve the detection and analysis of abnormalities in medical images, especially Computed Tomography Scan (CT scan images). CT scans provide detailed images of the body and are widely used to diagnose conditions such as cancer, injuries and diseases. However, CT scan interpretation can be difficult and time-consuming for radiologists, requiring early detection of abnormalities using advanced technologies such as AI, resulting in more accurate and prompt diagnosis.
Several recent studies have demonstrated the ability of AI to detect various abnormalities in CT images. These studies reported impressive results, demonstrating the potential of AI to help radiologists make more accurate and timely diagnosis. The integration of AI into CT scan analysis has the potential to revolutionize radiology by improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing interpretation time, and ultimately improving patient care.
Kidney disease is an important and growing problem worldwide and is one of the leading causes of death and contributes to disease worldwide. Many factors contribute to the rise in heart disease, such as an aging population, age -lack of exercise, poor diet, stress and mental health.
Using kidney CT imaging data, with images of normal kidneys, including tumors, tumors, and stones, to solve the classification problem. After a preprocessing step, we used two deep learning algorithms, VGG and AlexNet, to model.
